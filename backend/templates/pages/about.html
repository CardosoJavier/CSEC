            Regardless of their background or level of expertise. With a<br>

        <p>
            No prior knowledge of computers or engineering is required, as<br>
            many of our members have started with little to no knowledge<br>
            of cybersecurity and have gone on to become club leaders and<br>
            secure jobs in the industry.
